# My-campus
A Java-based college management application that handles student attendance, subject assignment, and administrative tasks. The system supports admin login, attendance reports, and structured academic data management to improve efficiency in educational institutions.

This project is a College Management System developed to simplify and automate day-to-day academic and administrative tasks in a college. The main goal of the system is to manage student information, subjects, attendance, and admin operations in a structured and efficient way.

How the System Works

The application provides role-based access, mainly for:

Admin

Users (students/faculty)

The Admin has full control over the system, such as managing students, subjects, and attendance records. Users can view relevant academic information assigned to them.

Key Features

Admin Login System
Secure login for administrators to prevent unauthorized access.

Student Management
Add, update, and manage student details like name, roll number, class, and department.

Subject Management
Subjects can be created and assigned to specific classes or students.

Attendance Management
Attendance can be marked and stored digitally, reducing manual paperwork.

Reports & Records
Attendance and academic records can be viewed easily whenever required.

Technology Used

Programming Language: Java

Database: MySQL (for storing student, subject, and attendance data)

Architecture: Simple layered structure for better data handling

Advantages of the System

Reduces manual work and paperwork

Saves time for faculty and administration

Improves data accuracy and consistency

Easy to use and maintain

Suitable for small to medium educational institutions

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how software can be used to digitize college operations and improve efficiency. It is especially useful as an academic or final-year project, showcasing practical knowledge of Java, database handling, and system design
